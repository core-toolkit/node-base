# node-base
Modular Node.js application framework

---
### `NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE`
This project is under heavy ongoing development and as such is yet unsuitable for any practical application:
- the interface is extremely unstable between versions
- there's a non-zero chance for data loss during migrations between versions
- a lot of what would be considered core functionality is still missing
---

## `Warning`
This framework fully manages the source code of the projects built with it. There is a good chance for code loss or corruption if installed into existing codebases which were not properly prepared.

## Installation
```sh
# in an empty directory
npm i @core-toolkit/node-base
